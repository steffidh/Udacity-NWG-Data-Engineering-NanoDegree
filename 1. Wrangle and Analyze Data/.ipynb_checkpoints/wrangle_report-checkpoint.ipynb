    "Once all the issues were documented, I followed the Define, Code, and Test to Clean the data using the knowledge I gained from the previous lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality Issues:\n",
    "1. Incorrect datatypes in twitter_archive_df (tweet_id, in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_user_id, timestamp, source, retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id, retweeted_status_timestamp): IDs (like tweet_id, in_reply_to_status_id etc.) should be treated as string type, and timestamp fields should be of datetime type.\n",
    "2. Source field in twitter_archive_df had html codes which won't be of any use during analysis and visualization.\n",
    "3. 5 columns(name, doggo, fluffer, pupper, puppo) in twitter_archive_df had None for NaN: None will be treated as a valid non null value in calculations, hence I changed all the None to NaN.\n",
    "4. There were many tweets having dog names which were not valid like a, an, the etc., so I removed all names starting with a lowercase.\n",
    "5. Deleted the Retweets so that we only have the original tweets.\n",
    "6. Removed the Tweet IDs from Archive table which were not present in Image Prediction file.\n",
    "7. There were incorrect numerators captured for tweets with decimal point ratings.\n",
    "8. Incorrect datatypes in predictions_df(tweet_id, p1, p2, p3).\n",
    "9. Removed p1_dog, p2_dog, p3_dog whihc were set as False as these are not dog types.\n",
    "10. Incorrect DataType for tweet_id in count_df\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tidiness Issues:\n",
    "1. Merged doggo, floofer, pupper, puppo in one column called dog_stage.\n",
    "2. Splited text column of archive table into two separate columns (tweet text and tweet_url).\n",
    "3. Combined p1, p1_conf, p1_dog, p2, p2_conf, p2_dog, p3, p3_conf, p3_dog into prediction_type, and cofindence_level columns as all these columns convey this information only.\n",
    "4. Joined all three dataframes into 1 dataframe called twitter_archive_master_df."
